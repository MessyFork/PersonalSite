          This website you are currently viewing was written with with ReactJS a JavaScript framework originally created by Facebook. As this was the second web project Iâ€™ve ever worked on I spent a significant amount of time to also learn the fundamental web technologies including HTML5 and Sass/CSS.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          The motivation behind this project was to avoid using jQuery and replace it with ReactJS. The logic behind this decision is that websites today have so many interactive aspects to them that it makes sense to build the entire site with JavaScript.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          Most of the work in this project was in adapting React and React-Router to work in a static website.
